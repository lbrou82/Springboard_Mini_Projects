# Springboard_Projects

Included are my Springboard exercises and mini projects. 



*Data Wrangling JSON:*
1. Find the 10 countries with most projects
2. Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
3. In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.

*SQL Mini Project:*
Consists of 10 questions about a "country_club" database. 
The database contains 3 tables:
    i) the "Bookings" table,
    ii) the "Facilities" table, and
    iii) the "Members" table.
