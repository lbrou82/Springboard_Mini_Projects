# Springboard_Projects

Included are my Springboard mini projects. 



*Data Wrangling JSON:*
1. Find the 10 countries with most projects
2. Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
3. In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.
